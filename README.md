- npm
- bower
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)

You may need to install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) since it's required to install SASS and compass.

To run the app, simply run the `grunt serve` command. It should automatically open the app in your default browser.
